Functions as Objects, Higher Order Functions, higher-order programming

In Python, functions are a first class object, like int or list
Functions can appear in expressions, as an argument to a funtion, elements of lists

type(abs) has value <class 'built-in_function_or_method'

type(myFunction) has value <class 'function'>
